    "## **1. Overview**\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to explore and analyze the VirtualHome environment by identifying key nodes and edges within different environments. The primary objectives of this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finding specific food items and retrieving their unique node IDs.\n",
    "- Identifying objects and their corresponding node IDs in various environments.\n",
    "- Exploring relationships between characters and objects.\n",
    "- Simulating interactions such as picking up food and storing it in objects like a fridge.\n",
    "- Querying object properties to understand their functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "By executing the different test functions, users can better understand how VirtualHome represents environments as graphs and how interactions are processed within the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing approach follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: The environment data is loaded, and key elements (objects, food items, etc.) are extracted.\n",
    "2. **Node and Edge Identification**: Objects and their relations are identified to ensure consistency in the representation.\n",
    "3. **Interaction Simulation**: Actions such as picking up, storing, and using objects are tested in the environment.\n",
    "4. **Property Validation**: The attributes of objects are queried and validated against expected values.\n",
    "5. **Performance Monitoring**: Execution times and memory usage are monitored to identify potential bottlenecks.\n"

    "This function initializes the VirtualHome environment, adds a character, and simulates interactions with a food item (salmon). It queries and updates the character's relationship with the object step by step.  \n",

    "- **Purpose**: To verify that a character can interact with food objects correctly, and that the environment updates accordingly.  \n",
    "- **Method**:  \n",
    "  1. Initialize the VirtualHome environment using `comm_unity.UnityCommunication`.  \n",
    "  2. Reset the environment to its initial state.  \n",
    "  3. Add a character to the environment using `comm.add_character(CHARACTER_NAME)`.  \n",
    "  4. Retrieve the environment graph and extract the character ID.  \n",
    "  5. Query the node ID and relationships of a specific food item (`salmon`).  \n",
    "  6. Print the initial relationships of the salmon object.  \n",
    "  7. Query and print the character’s initial relationships.  \n",
    "  8. Simulate a character walking to the salmon using `comm.render_script()`.  \n",
    "  9. Query and print the updated character relationships.  \n",
    "  10. Simulate a character grabbing the salmon.  \n",
    "  11. Query and print the final character relationships after the action.  \n",
    "  12. Close the communication with the environment after execution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected Result**:  \n",
    "  - The salmon object should have identifiable relationships in the initial state.  \n",
    "  - The character should successfully walk to the salmon.  \n",
    "  - The character should be able to grab the salmon, and the environment graph should reflect this change."
